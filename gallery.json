There is a fantastic write-up by Shawn Sejera about this book which you can read on the <a href=\"https://nsxclubeurope.com/2017/01/nsxmobilia-top-10-the-nsx-story/\" target=\"_blank\">NSX-CE site</a>. <em>“If Soichiro Honda’s axiom of life’s value being ‘measured by the number of times your soul has been deeply stirred’ then value has certainly been created. The book has stirred my soul. The NSX Story is an inherently beautiful book that can tell the NSX’s tale, in a compelling way, just through its design execution and pictures.”</em>",
